# JQLClassFree

This module (<b>JQ</b>uery<b>L</b>ike) was inspired by the idea that some JQuery was too good <a target="_blank" href="http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/" rel="nofollow">to ditch</a>.

It is developed in a modular fashion and uses plain ES20xx, so not really (or really not, take your pick) suitable for older browsers.

The module is written in a <i>classfree object oriented</i> fashion, inspired by a <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/XFTOG895C7c?t=2562">Douglas Crockford presentation</a>. The objective is to ***not** use `prototype` and `this` **anywhere*** in the code.
