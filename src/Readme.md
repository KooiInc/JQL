# JQL: a HTMLElement extension module (JQuery alike)

This library is inspired by the idea that some JQuery was too good 
[to ditch](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/).

It is developed in a modular fashion and uses ES20xx. 

It is *not* a replacement for [JQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery). 
Consider it a subset of JQuery <i>alike</i> methods for (collections of) HTML elements within a HTML document. 

The module can either be imported in a [compiled](../lib/JQLBundle.js) - or 
[full code](../src/JQueryLike.js) version.

Here is the documentation for all used methods. [Start with](/api/JQL.html#.ExtendedNodeList) 
reading this.

**Have fun!**
